# Golang Gu√≠a - Mini

In this practice project, I dedicate myself to working with basic programming tools and code such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of practicing Web Development. All the content expressed in it is not my own, only the design of the website as well as the written code.

At the moment, it is a work in progress, and once completed, it will be available in web version. It is non-profit, only intended as a coding practice.
